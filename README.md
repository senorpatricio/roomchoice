Roomchoice projects

This is a a website I created using different ways to code it. I used Custom HTML/CSS (pixel-perfect), Bootstrap responsive, Preprocessed CSS (SASS/Compass).

This was an experiment in learning new ways to code the same thing, as well as learning to write concise code and eliminating excess. By the time I started to use SASS I was able to cut down on excess quite a bit.

Feel free to leave feedback on my code. I love a chance to improve!
